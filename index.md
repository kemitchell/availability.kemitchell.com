This page describes the kinds of working relationships I seek and my availability for new ones.

Generally speaking, I serve four kinds of clients as legal counsel: [regular clients](#regular), [project clients](#project), [standby clients](#standby), and [pro bono clients](#probono).  I also support some [lawyer colleagues](#colleagues) who need help with specific questions from time to time, as I'm supported by others.

## Regular Clients {#regular}

I could take one more regular client.  [E-mail me anytime.](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com)
{: .success}

Regular clients require substantial time each workweek, and sometimes each workday, many workdays in a row.  Their needs can vary widely, month to month.  Typically, regular clients see me as "inside-out counsel", or outside counsel working as general counsel.

Regular clients pay a flat monthly fee for my services.  The flat fee can be renegotiated anytime, but fee changes apply only to future months, never retroactively.

My regular clients pay a minimum of $6,000 (USD) per month.

## Project Clients {#project}

I am available to take new project clients.  [E-mail me anytime.](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com)
{: .success}

Project clients hire me to help with specific legal projects or deals.  When a project ends, the working relationship ends with it.  In legal jargon, project clients have "limited-scope engagements".

I'm always happy to hear from former project clients about new opportunities.  But I don't commit to stay available to project clients after the current project.

Some project clients pay an hourly rate and expenses.  Some project clients play flat rates, for the whole project, per week, or otherwise.  Depends on the project.

My going rate for new project work is $500 (USD) per hour.  I occasionally lower my rate for clients paying out of pocket, as individuals.

## Standby Clients {#standby}

I'm not currently taking new standby clients.
{: .danger}

Standby clients require my help unpredictably.  Sometimes deals for standby clients require work for several weeks in a row.  Sometimes standby clients go months without messaging me at all.  Standby clients often see me as "inside-out counsel"---outside counsel working as general counsel---but their needs are minimal.

Standby clients pay an hourly rate plus expenses.

## Pro Bono Clients {#probono}

I'm not currently taking new pro bono clients.
{: .danger}

Pro bono clients do not pay.

Pro bono clients' needs vary.  However, I usually seek pro bono clients with needs more like [regular clients](#regular) than [project clients](#project).

## Colleagues

I'm always happy to meet and support fellow lawyers.  [Send me an e-mail anytime.](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com)
{: .success}

Fellow lawyers aren't law clients, but lawyers themselves.  However, colleagues occasionally need help with specific questions, often out of client work, that point to my legal and technical background.

When colleagues expect to send me questions for specific clients of theirs here and there, they often ask to pay an hourly rate.

I am always happy to discuss interesting new developments, problems, and hypotheticals with other attorneys who have as much to teach me as I have to teach them.  Sometimes I feel I should pay _them_.  I'm happy to do so!
